* Description
  This Project was carried out for educational purpose, it's main objective is to implement a problem solving algorithm in the game /Jeu De Taquin/. Two heuristics were chosen in order to find the optimal solution:
  - Non Similar Boxes :: For each cell of the matrix that doesn't match with the final matrix the cost is incremented by 1, but actually it's incremented by 2 because a cell doesn't match it's final cell implies that another cell doesn't match too since the game is about swapping cells.
  - Euclidian Distance :: For each cell /A/ we calculate the euclidian distance from that cell to the cell /B/ containing the digit that should be in the final matrix in cell /A/. When the digit is in the right cell the distance is equal to 0.
* Building
  Open =main.pde= as a [[https://processing.org/][Processing]] sketch, install =G4P= library and run the sketch.
* Controls
** PLAY mode
   These controls are used for swapping the empty cell with other cells.
|---------+------------------------------------------|
| Button  | Action                                   |
|---------+------------------------------------------|
| =UP=    | Swap the empty cell with the upper cell  |
| =DOWN=  | Swap the empty cell with the bottom cell |
| =RIGHT= | Swap the empty cell with the right cell  |
| =LEFT=  | Swap the empty cell with the left cell   |
** AUTO 1 and AUTO 2 modes
   These controls are used to explore the steps of the solution when it is found.
|---------+---------------------------|
| Button  | Action                    |
|---------+---------------------------|
| =RIGHT= | Move to the next step     |
| =LEFT=  | Move to the previous step |
** EDIT 1 and EDIT 2 modes
|----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Button               | Action                                                        |
|----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| =Right mouse button= | Swaps between the two cells which where clicked consecutively |
